## Building

```sh
make
```


## Testing

```sh
# e2e tests
sh tests/e2e/run.sh
```


## Development

You can read [the docs here](docs/read-this.md) and if you ever
happen to stuck, I probably have a tutorial for it in [here](docs/misc/resources.md).


## Tech stack

- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): as the build system
- [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/): as the compiler
