# Getting Started

The main issue I've realized is that people generally don't know where to start.
Here, let me show you how simple it is!


## Modules

Every folder within the root directory, is a __module__.

Currenly there are 3 modules:

* [lp](mods/lp),   The Lord parser.
* [lc](mods/lc),   The Lord compiler.
* [cli](mods/cli), Lord's command line interface

You can click on the links to go to the respective modules' documentation.


## I can't understand the code!

Be fine on there, I've prepared you with plenty of resources to learn from!
[Here, take a look](misc/resources.md).


## I dunno how to help!
