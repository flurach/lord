# Getting Started

The main issue I've realized is that people generally don't know where to start.
Here, let me show you how simple it is!


## Modules

Currenly there are 3 modules:

* [`lp`](mods/lp),   The Lord Parser.
* [`lc`](mods/lc),   The Lord Compiler.
* [`cli`](mods/cli), Lord's Command Line Interface

You can click on the links to go to the respective modules' documentation.


## I can't understand the code!

Be fine on there, I've prepared you with plenty of resources to learn from!
[Here, take a look](misc/resources.md).


## I am still confused :(
