# Getting Started

The main issue I've realized is that people generally don't know where to start.
Here, let me show you how simple it is!


## Modules

Every folder within the root directory, is a __module__.
Unless it starts with an `_` character.

Currenly there are 3 modules:

* [cli](mods/cli), Lord's command line interface
* [lc](mods/lc),   The Lord compiler.
* [vm](mods/vm),   Lord's virtual machine.

You can click on the links to go to the respective modules' documentation.


## I can't understand the code!

Be fine on there, I've prepared you with plenty of resources to learn from!
[Here, take a look](misc/resources.md).


## I dunno how to help!

Make sure to read [this](misc/coding-style.md) and study with the resources on where you want to help.
If you still don't know what to do, come contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbugrayildiz).
