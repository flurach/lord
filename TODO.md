# TODO

> Note to self: __This idea is redundant (for now)__
- [ ] have the parser generate CST
- [ ] convert CST to AST afterwards

- [ ] add a way annotate types of functions
- [ ] refactor the parser (eol)

- [X] fully implement arithmetic operators (for Ints)
- [ ] update tests to include code generation
- [ ] type inference
- [ ] type checking
- [ ] fully implement arithmetic operators (for Floats)
- [ ] fully implement arithmetic operators (for Strings)
- [ ] fully implement logic operators

- [ ] have a pass to validate AST
- [ ] write a virtual machine with a close-to-assembly instruction set
- [ ] compile a fibonacci program to that VM's opcodes
- [ ] convert VM opcodes to assembly
