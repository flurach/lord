# TODO

> Note to self: __This idea is redundant (for now)__
- [ ] have the parser generate CST
- [ ] convert CST to AST afterwards

- [ ] have a pass to validate AST
- [ ] write a virtual machine with a close-to-assembly instruction set
- [ ] compile a fibonacci program to that VM's opcodes
- [ ] convert VM opcodes to assembly
